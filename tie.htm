<font size="4">this<b>IS</b><i>edinburgh</i> is the ironically eye-rolling catchphrase of citycyclingedinburgh.info

<p></p>

Members (usually) use it when City of Edinburgh Council has done (or not done) something that doesn't improve the life of the City's cyclists and pedestrians.

<p></p>

CEC believes in promoting Active Travel and working towards a World-Class Cycling City.

<p></p>

Any similarity between this<b>IS</b><i>edinburgh</i> and tie who delivered the trams on time and on budget is purely coincidental.
